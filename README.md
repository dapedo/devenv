# Development environment

### `install.sh`

This script will automatically install the following packages: Typora, VsCode, Insomnia, zsh, grub-customizer. As well as some needed dependencies.

### How to use

Just execute `sudo sh install.sh` and you're good to go. By now it will stop on the oh my zsh installation, since it opens the oh my zsh process, so you have to continue manually.
